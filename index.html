			<h1>Who are we?</h1>
			<br />
			<h2>Chennai Institute of Technology</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				The Chennai Institute of Technology (CIT) was founded with the goal of
				offering quality technical education with enough industrial exposure,
				and it responds to the requirements of the young through creative
				teaching techniques. Mr. P. Sriram, the chairman, has been a successful
				first-generation entrepreneur in the metro for the past two decades, and
				his knowledge of the business fueled his desire to construct a technical
				educational institution under the name Chennai Institute of Technology.
				With a staff of committed academic members, this school delivers
				exceptional technical education. The campus is wired at 155 Mbps and
				wireless at 100 Mbps, with very complex technology and state-of-the-art
				laboratories. CIT has large and ventilated classrooms, labs with the
				most up-to-date high-tech equipment, and a digitalized central library
				with over 17000 volumes of books, National and International journals
				and magazines. Chennai Institute of Technology has played a significant
				role in promoting higher education for our students in technologically
				sophisticated countries. There are many students who want to study and
				work in other countries, and about 200 students are now enrolled in
				Japanese and German language classes.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				CIT provides eight Undergraduate Courses (Mechanical, CSE, ECE, EEE,
				Civil, Mechatronics, Bio-Medical, IT, AI and Data science, Computer
				science and Business systems) and three Post Graduate Courses (CAD/CAM,
				CSE, and Applied Electronics). The institution thrusts on imparting the
				employability skill among the students in order to bridge the gap
				between the Institution and Industries and to equip the students with
				the current industrial skillset, CIT has established different training
				centers and Centre of Excellences such as, CIT – KUKA Industrial
				Robotics Training Centre - South India’s 1st Industrial Robot Training
				Centre in association with KUKA, Germany , CIT-Mobitics Mobile Centre of
				Excellence - India’s 1st Mobile Apps Development Centre , CIT – Accurate
				Calibration Centre - Centre of Excellence in CMM and Measurements, CIT
				Skill Development Centre affiliated to Automotive Skills Development
				Council (ASDC), Govt. of India, CIT – MK Auto Research Centre etc.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				We are one of South India's top-rated universities for industry contacts
				and industry-collaborated activities. Our campus contains Technology
				Business Incubators, with close to 40 Incubant enterprises engaging in
				product development and industry consulting. CIT has worked with a
				number of international institutes, including Tianjin Vocational College
				of Mechanics and Electricity in China, RWTH Aachen University in
				Germany, Kyutech Institute of Technology in Japan, and Dongguk
				University in South Korea.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Mechanical Engineering</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Mechanical engineering is the discipline that designs, analyzes,
				manufactures, and maintains mechanical systems using concepts from
				engineering, physics, engineering mathematics, and materials science. It
				is one of the oldest and most comprehensive engineering specialties.
				Mechanical engineering involves a solid grasp of fundamental concepts
				such as mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science,
				structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these fundamental
				principles, mechanical engineers design and analyze manufacturing
				plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems,
				transportation systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices,
				weapons, and other items using tools such as computer-aided design
				(CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product life cycle
				management. It is the branch of engineering concerned with the design,
				manufacture, and operation of machines.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Mechgust 2K22</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Mechgust 2K22 is a long-running tradition with a nationwide reach. It's
				a place where pleasure and wisdom collide. We offer technical activities
				that put your engineering abilities to the test, as well as
				non-technical ones that keep you entertained throughout the day. We have
				roughly 5 technical and non-technical events, as well as 4 workshops,
				that will make you want to be a Mechanical Engineer...!
