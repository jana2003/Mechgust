          <h1>MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT</h1>
          <p>
            Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering,
            physics, engineering mathematics, and materials science principles
            to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It
            is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines.
            The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core
            areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials
            science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these
            core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as
            computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and
            product life cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing
            plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling
            systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical
            devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that
            involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.
